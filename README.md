## Project Overview
Drug recommendation systems powered by advanced analytics are rapidly becoming more important in healthcare. With vast amounts of medical data and research available, it can be challenging for healthcare professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest treatments and medications.

These data-driven drug recommendation systems are transforming healthcare by helping professionals stay updated with treatments and medications. They analyze patient data to identify drug interactions and prevent errors, ensuring accurate dosing and better outcomes.

In this project, we’ll create a recommendation system using NLP and machine learning to predict medical conditions and suggest the top 3 drugs based on reviews. We’ll start with the Drug Reviews dataset from the UCI ML Repository, preprocess the data, and build and evaluate models to classify conditions and recommend drugs with high ratings.

## Reading Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,61,297 reviews of the users with 7 columns.

The dataset consists of drug names, medical conditions, textual reviews of the user, rating given by the user, date of the review, and a total number of useful count which means a total number of users who find the review useful.

To make it simple we will select the top 4 medical conditions i.e.,

      1.'Birth Control'
      
      2'Depression'
      
      3'Pain'
      
      4 'Anxiety'
